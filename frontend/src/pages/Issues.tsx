        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-8 text-gray-200 text-2xl">
          <li>If the base game updated recently expect mods to be broken and/or outdated.</li>
          <li>Ensure the problem isn&apos;t already mentioned in the Known Issues section.</li>
          <li>
            Rank requirements are achieved 1 rank too early (eg. a skill with rank requirement of 10 can be selected
            when the character is rank 9). This is just a quirk of I chose to show the character rank, in game the
            character ranks up, unlocks requirements, then you get to choose where the point goes. With TWP you
            effectively rank up upon taking the skill. Allowing you to rank the skill 1 rank &quot;early&quot;
            effectively matches how the game works. If you find an instance where this doesnt match game behavior let me
            know.

            If it is related to a pink icon (
            <img src={placeholderImage} alt="placeholder image" width="59" height="59" className="inline w-6 h-6" />
            ), that is a placeholder icon. If this is somewhere in a tooltip it is probably related to a hidden skill
            effect. I&apos;ve decided to generally leave hidden or background effects in for more information, but might
            try to prune more empty entries at some point. Please do not report these unless you think it is a real
            error, such as a character portrait, or skill icon.
